<p><pre>Pochettino played as a central defender and began his career in 1989 with Primera División club Newell's Old Boys, winning a league title 
                        and finishing as runner-up in the 1992 Copa Libertadores. In 1994, at age 22, he transferred to newly-promoted La Liga club Espanyol, helping 
    establish their top-flight status and won the 2000 Copa del Rey, their first trophy in 60 years. In 2001, he joined Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain, and had
                        a stint with Bordeaux, before returning to Espanyol in 2004, winning another Copa del Rey in 2006.[3] He was capped 20 times for the 
    Argentina played at the 1999 Copa América and 2002 FIFA World Cup.

    After retiring as a player, Pochettino began his managerial career at Espanyol in 2009. He left the club in 2012 after poor
             results and financial disputes. In 2013, he was appointed at Premier League club Southampton, leading them to an eighth-place
                    finish in the 2013–14 season – equalling their highest finish in the Premier League. He then signed for Tottenham Hotspur in 2014,
                           finishing as league runner-up in the 2016–17 season and UEFA Champions League finalist in 2019. He was soon dismissed after a string
                                   of poor results,[4] and in 2021, joined Paris Saint-Germain as head coach.</pre></p>
